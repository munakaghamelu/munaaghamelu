# What is React?

React is a JS tool for building frontend websites.
It is part of bootstrap, which is a platform that provides website templates I believe.

# Plan of action
1. Create react app ✔️
2. Delete parts not needed
3. Collect assets from figma design and add to public/assets
4. Choose font from Google fonts and add to the index.html header
5. Edit index.html to include website title, add font-family
6. Create components folder: website components []
7. Change App.js to jsx -> why do I do this? What is 'jsx'?
8. Add scss files -> why do I do this? What is the difference between scss and css?
9. Convert all Figma design pages to react app
10. Complete site
11. Deploy on GitHub pages

# Questions to answer

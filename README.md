### Learning Notes

# What is React?

React is a JS tool for building frontend websites.
It is part of bootstrap, which is a platform that provides website templates I believe.

# Plan of action
1. Create react app ✔️
2. Delete parts not needed
3. Collect assets from figma design and add to public/assets
4. Choose font from Google fonts and add to the index.html header
5. Edit index.html to include website title, add font-family
6. Create components folder: website components []
7. Change App.js to jsx -> why do I do this? What is 'jsx'?
8. Add scss files -> why do I do this? What is the difference between scss and css?
9. Convert all Figma design pages to react app
10. Complete site
11. Deploy on GitHub pages

# Questions to answer
1. What is a React component?
2. How do functions work in React?

---------------------------------------

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
